# onlineAnalysis
MATLAB GUI for online real-time analysis of neurophysiology data. 
Data is streamed from a Blackrock neural signal processor using Blackrock's CBMEX function. Stimulus parameters are read from specifically formatted comment strings sent through the instrument network.

## Required

CBMEX, see http://blackrockmicro.com/neuroscience-research-products/ephys-analysis-software/matlab-development-kits/

## Folders

tests: scrap and testing code used before developing the rest of the application

## Instructions

Run GUI_Online_Master.m. GUI use should be fairly intuitive, but there'll eventually be a proper user guide here.
